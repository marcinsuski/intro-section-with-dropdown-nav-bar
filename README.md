## Overview
I chose this challenge mainyl to learn and practice creating dropdown navigation and burger button for mobile view. 
Project demands more styling and media queries for navigation bar styling (different positions in mobile and pc view). There is also place for some small animations along with the navigation bard.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
1. I decided to create PC view first as I had to plan the navigation menu and submenus which seemed more complicated.
2. I started from html structure: main parts of the layout, then navigation bar and in the end main content. 
3. Afterwards I created media query for mobile view and started styling burger button and navigation tab in mobile view. I made javascript for burger button to be sure everything works.
4. In the end I styled the submenus for pc view and mobile view.

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned
I practiced making burger button for mobile layouts and learned creating dropdown navigation bar. Javascript part is very simple - just toggling css classes for visibility of particular objects. Styling for various layouts took me the most time.
